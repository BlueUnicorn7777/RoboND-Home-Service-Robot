# RoboND-Home-Service-Robot
This project demonstrates the use of several ros packages including slam_gmapping , amcl , map_server , turtlebot , turtlebot_interactions , turtlebot_simulator etc to create a simulated home service robot. The home service robot ( turtlebot for this project) will autonomously navigate itâ€™s world and localize itself in the map file. The pick_object node publishes pickup and drop off goal locations to turtlebot robot using move_base server and SimpleActionClient. ROS navigation stack creates a path for turtlebot based on Dijkstra's algorithm, while avoiding obstacles on its path.  
The final simulation will show -  
A marker at the pickup zone.  
Will hide the marker once the robot reaches the pickup zone.  
Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup.  
Will show the drop off marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches there.

### ROS Packages used -
#### slam_gmapping  
This package is used create a map of the existing gazebo world file. To test out the features run the catkin_ws/scripts/test_slam.sh script and drive the robot around the world.  
https://github.com/ros-perception/slam_gmapping  
http://wiki.ros.org/slam_gmapping  
#### turtlebot  
This package provides all the basic drivers for running and using a turtlebot.  
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot  
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot  
#### turtlebot_interactions
Package supporting user side interactions with the turtlebot.  
https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot_interactions  
http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_interactions  
#### turtlebot_simulator  
This package contains Launchers for Gazebo simulation of the turtlebot.

### Project Packages created

#### map
The generated map files are stored in this package and referred in the launch files from this location.
#### world 
The gazebo world file is stored in the package.     
#### pick_objects
This package will send simultaneous pickup and drop off goal locations to turtlebot robot using move_base server and SimpleActionClient.
ROS navigation stack creates a path for turtlebot based on Dijkstra's algorithm, while avoiding obstacles on its path.
#### add_marker
This package will create markers in rviz and show/hide/move them to simulate the virtual pick up and dropoff of object by turtlebot.
The task is to 
Publish the marker at the pickup zone  
Pause 5 seconds  
Hide the marker  
Pause 5 seconds  
Publish the marker at the drop off zone 
#### rviz_launcher
The modifed rviz files and launch script can be found here.

### Script Files -
#### launch.sh
Basic tutorial to create and test the script files.
#### test_slam.sh
![mapping and localization](https://github.com/BlueUnicorn7777/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot/blob/main/gif/mapping.gif)
Script to run the slam_gmapping and create a map of the world by teleoperating the robot around the world. After the map is created save it using  rosrun map_server map_saver <name_of_map>
This script will spawn turtlebot in the mySmallWorld world file , along with other launch files - gmapping_demo.launch , view_navigation.launch , keyboard_teleop.launch.

#### test_navigation.sh!
![Navigation](https://github.com/BlueUnicorn7777/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot/blob/main/gif/navigation.gif)

This script will launch the mySmallWorld file along with turtlebot in gazebo. The map created by slam_gmapping is launched in rviz by setting the env variables -
TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_WORLD_FILE=$(rospack find world)/mySmallWorld.world and TURTLEBOT_GAZEBO_MAP_FILE=$(rospack find map)/map.yaml. The amcl_demo.launch file will launch the amcl nodes and the navigation and localization can be tested by sending the 2D nav goal using rviz. 
#### pick_objects.sh
![pick_objects](https://github.com/BlueUnicorn7777/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot/blob/main/gif/pick_objects.gif)
Run this script to watch turtlebot autonomously navigate from pickup location to drop off location. This script will launch the following files 
turtlebot_world.launch , amcl_demo.launch , view_navigation.launch and finally the pick_objects.launch. 
#### add_markers.sh
![add_markers](https://github.com/BlueUnicorn7777/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot/blob/main/gif/add_markers.gif)
#### home_service.sh
![home_service](https://github.com/BlueUnicorn7777/RoboND-Home-Service-Robot/blob/main/gif/home_service.gif)

Run this script as shown above in to Clone and Run section to see the complete simulation for the autonomous pickup and dropoff of the virtual marker object by turtlebot in mySmallWorld.
This script will lauch following files -
turtlebot_world.launch ,amcl_demo.launch,view_navigation.launch view_navigation.launch , add_markers and pick_objects.
